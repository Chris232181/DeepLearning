# LSTM Stock Predictor
Which model has a lower loss? The model without the FNG Index had a lower loss of .011 compared the the model with the FNG Index, .101.

Which model tracks the actual values better over time? The model without the FNG Index had better performance over the long and short term.

Which window size works best for the model? The curve of the prediction smooths out when the window size is increase. Increasing the window size did not improve the results of the model without the FNG Index.
